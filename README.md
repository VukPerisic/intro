* Also install Node.JS and npm and verify both are available on your device

1. Click the "Code" button and copy the HTTPS web URL 

2. Create local folder in your terminal for the project

3. cd into the folder and glone the repo 
    - `git clone HTTPS_URL`

4. cd into the project directory and create a local branch

   Please reach out via Slack or email if you have any questions or get stuck!
