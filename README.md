## Setup
***
*Before starting, ensure you have Git installed in your terminal. You can use the command “git –version” to check if it is installed. 
* Also install Node.JS and npm and verify both are available on your device
***

1. Click the “Code” button and copy the HTTPS web URL 
2. Create a local folder/directory in your terminal for the project 
- mkdir your_folder_name
3. Clone the git repo 
- git clone HTTPS_URL (the link you copied earlier)
4. Navigate into the project directory 
- cd intro
5. Create a new local branch and switch to it
- git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME	
6. Complete the css-assignment and react-project (they are independent so they can be done in any order)


# After finishing
Make sure you are on your local branch (git branch checks it for you) and run the following commands to add and push your code changes: 

git add .
git commit -m “completed project” (or any message in the quotes)
git pushSe
